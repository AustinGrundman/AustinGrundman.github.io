<h id="the_title">Rick and Morty: The Fight Between Rick and the Rest</h>


<p class="white">Rick and Morty is a TV cartoon show with 4 seasons consisting of 41 total episodes. The idea of the show is travelling with a genius grandpa (Rick) and his grandson (Morty) into parallel universes where they encounter endless unique and creative locations and entities. Those two along with the rest of the family have constant quarrels and fights with sarcastic delivery which makes it a hoot to watch and really easy to binge. If you would like to see more on the overall summary of the show, here is a <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty"> link</a> to their Wikipedia page</p>

<p>Of the relationships which I enjoy to watch, it is incredibly fun to see how Rick disapproves of his son-in-law, Jerry, and all the doofy things he does. That along with the encounters between Rick and his daughter Beth because of how sarcastic the conversations are between those two as well. Rick is definetly the person who 'stirs the pot' and creates the most issues, but at the same time, he fixes the most stuff and cares a crazy amount about his family.</p>

<p class="white">The reason why Rick disapproves is because of Jerry is because Jerry is incredibly insecure and gets himself into situations where he is obviously seen as the 'beta', all the while Rick being an extreme 'alpha'. Ultimately, each one of the times Rick and Jerry have an encounter, Rick is put into a position where he must save Jerry because he cannot manage himself in the situations he gets into. For more information on Rick's personality, click <a href ="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Jerry_Smith"> here</a>, you can also get insider information on the rest of the characters.</p>

<p>For the most part, Jerry is not in many episodes, and when he is, there is a lot of back and forth between him and the rest of his family. It pretty much seems as though the only role Jerry really needs to play is the person who everyone makes fun of.</p>

<p class="white">Below is a graph which shows the frequency of each of the members making an appearance in each of the episodes. If you will notice, Jerry is appearing the least and Rick is tied with Morty with the most frequent. It is not suprising to me to see that as Jerry seems to only play one role of being made fun of, while the rest of the family requents more of the adventures with Rick and Morty. I got this information from the Rick and Morty open source API which shares information on charachters, episodes, and so on. <a href ="https://rickandmortyapi.com/"> Here</a> is where you can find the API I used if you are curious what other questions can be asked.</p>
