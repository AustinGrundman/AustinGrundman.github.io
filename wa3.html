<p>To be honest, I don't keep up with this sort of thing so most of my opinion is based off of a couple of articles I skimmed before reading this. Luckily, I have been able to figure out sublime text and the assignment well enough to submit it, so here goes.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href ="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/1/31/the-gamestop-affair-was-not-about-class-resentment-or-revenge"> link</a> to the first source I had read.</p> 

<p>I mostly think it is interesting how the public was able to make such an impact. From my understanding, Reddit is a vast and interestingly unique place with more power than thought. For this number of people to be on the same page and to work together to provide this sort of outcome is impressive.</p>

<p>Though it is impressive, it is nothing which hasn't been done before. There have been these bull raids going on for quite some time and, by the looks of it, usually done by already rich people trying to get more money. Personally, I am impressed that such a vast community was able to accomplish the same thing since the organization takes so much more when working on the web. I was particularly intrigued with this <a href ="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/gamestop-wall-street-bets.html"> link</a> did a good job explaining to me how it was pulled off.</p>

<p>I see now that the stock has adjusted to a more recognizable number for Gamestop and that is not as suprising since 'the internet only remembers things for 2 weeks' and whatnot. Sociologically, a huge wave seems to have come and gone within the interest of these 'meme stocks' but I still think the initial accomplishment is quite awesome. If you would like a current update, here is a <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze"> link</a> to the Wikipedia page with live updates on Game Stop's stock.</p>

<p>If you would like a quick sum up of what occured, here it goes.
<ul>
  <li>A short squeeze of the stock happened in late January 2021</li>
  <li>Game Stop's stock price rose by 30 fold</li>
  <li>The stock has returned to a more normal number after restrictions and lawsuits were filed</li>
