<p>For the main redesign, I made all of the functions available from one screen so that you don't have to navigate around multiple pages to find what you are looking for, it is all right in front of you. To do this, I utilized columns to make them look clean and well sepereated at the bottom of the page. For the Resume page, the only change is that it is a hyperlink which looks more sleek as a header and has an explaination of what to expect underneath it. For the contact information page, I made it clear to click on the button if you wish to contact me. For the portfolio, I did the same effect as with the Resume to make it more of a seemless transition, and to make it a cleaner overall page.</p>

<p>For the element not covered in class, I made a very simple footer</p>
