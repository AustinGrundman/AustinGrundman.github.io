<h>Gamestop and Sociology</h>

<p>To be honest, I don't keep up with this sort of thing so most of my opinion is based off of a couple of articles I skimmed before reading this. Luckily, I have been able to figure out sublime text and the assignment well enough to submit it, so here goes.</p>

<p>I mostly think it is interesting how the public was able to make such an impact. From my understanding, Reddit is a vast and interestingly unique place with more power than thought. For this number of people to be on the same page and to work together to provide this sort of outcome is impressive.</p>

<p>Though it is impressive, it is nothing which hasn't been done before. There have been these bull raids going on for quite some time and, by the looks of it, usually done by already rich people trying to get more money. Personally, I am impressed that such a vast community was able to accomplish the same thing since the organization takes so much more when working on the web.</p>

<p>I see now that the stock has adjusted to a more recognizable number for Gamestop and that is not as suprising since 'the internet only remembers things for 2 weeks' and whatnot. Sociologically, a huge wave seems to have come and gone within the interest of these 'meme stocks' but I still think the initial accomplishment is quite awesome. </p>

<p>This is paragraph number 5 &#128512;</p>
